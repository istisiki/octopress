In this trying time I'd like to take a moment to appreciate the efforts of my
"less words, more actions" father.

We all heard how Yolanda/Haiyan did a number on many coastal towns in the
Visayas. It sucks pretty bad right now. Catbalogan, my hometown and where my 
parents and youngest brother live, endured minimal damage. A few roofs were 
blown away, electricity is down but was promised to be back soon. Tacloban, 
where my aunts, grandmother, and cousins live suffered tremendously. Most of 
the city is unlivable. Recovery will take a very long time.

With all forms of modern communication down in most parts of Tacloban, we 
couldn't get a hold of our relatives. So my father being the superman that he 
is, braved this ground zero. The van couldn't go beyond San Juanico Bridge. 
No van? No problem. He walked. For two hours. Carrying canned goods, water, 
rice, and other stuff. He was approached by a stranger desperate for water 
but thankfully this stranger was only offering his cellphone (and not a knife) 
in exchange.

He arrived at my grandmother and aunts' house. Some of the roofing materials 
were blown off, some water damage due to floods but the humans were OK. A 
little shaken but alive.

Oh, and to get back to our home, he walked back to San Juanico Bridge, another 
two hours. No more canned goods though so at least this trip was lighter. Then 
off to find a van to ride for that 2-hour trip.

Last week, my officemates and I had a conversation on who we think would survive 
the Hunger Games if we had one. I don't think I'd win but I'll put up a fight. 
Expect me to go down swingin' and poison you before I die. (I'd also threaten 
to poison you if you try to kill me so you better not!) My father, on the other 
hand, has a real chance at it. He has all the prerequisite skills--can read a 
map, can start a fire, can cook, can fish, can swim, can sing (Katniss sang to 
Rue, didn't she?), and if weaponry was still a thing, he'd probably know how to 
use a bow and arrow (for ranged attacks) and a bolo (for old school melee). Add 
to the equation a loved one in need of help, and he's practically unstoppable.

Cheers to our family's very own superman.

*[2013-11-12] The last I heard from my parents, the plan was to bring my 
  relatives from Tacloban to our town. Our house can't accommodate that many 
  people (at least ten people would be coming). We'll figure it out. On the 
  bright side, we're having a family reunion this year and we already have a 
  venue.*

*[2013-11-13] [Update][tumblr-update-1]
  Some Yolanda survivors have relocated to Catbalogan and supplies might get 
  low.[More details][tumblr-update-1]*

*[2013-11-18] Everyone is safe. :) Lechon is now being sold in Tacloban's
  Real Street. Progress.*
