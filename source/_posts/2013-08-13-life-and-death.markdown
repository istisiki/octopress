No matter how many times I experience Alaska's suicide in Miles' perspective, or empathize with K's disjoint sadness on Sumire's disappearance, or see the horror in Catelyn's eyes when she knew for certain her firstborn will never survive, or be irrationally angry that Rowling didn't let Tonks survive the series as she first intended...

I am still ill prepared to experience a relative's passing first hand. My impulse is to push aside all emotion. In all honesty, <a href="http://blog.staceycardoso.com/2013/05/11/life-sucks-right-now/" target="_blank">when this started</a>, I expected my grandmother will go first. It is easier since at the back of our mind, we already know this is inevitable for grandparents. However, the longevity of the women on my father's side has yet again proven itself.

The doctors never found out what happened. An inexplicable illness that looks and feels like a very rabid pneumonia. Lupus, maybe, but it takes years to diagnose and even then it's not easy. We only had months.
