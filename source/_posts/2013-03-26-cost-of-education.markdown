I pride my self in being educated by the public school system my whole life. (Except in daycare but that hardly counts. You can enter elementary school without daycare pseudo-education.) My heart also swells with joy whenever I recount that I got a much coveted scholarship for a <a href="http://www.pshs.edu.ph/" target="_blank">science high school</a>. So not only did I need not pay for tuition, the school gave us allowance just by being present. I even brag to my sisters that I probably have the cheapest education among the three of us. So I was a shocked when I actually made educated guestimations on the cost of my education. The amount almost reached half a million pesos! I am never having kids.

Here's the breakdown:

In high school my parents gave me 700 pesos a week but only around 300 pesos per month would be taken from their own pockets since the school gave us allowance as well. My board and laundry was for a year and a half in high school when my parents decided it would be better to have me live walking distance from the school. This amount also included daily breakfast.

In college, my allowance was 1000 pesos a week. Surprisingly enough, this gets me through complete meals (almost) daily, plus at least one good book every month. I transferred to a solo room in my junior year because my old boarding house was closing down. The solo room was more expensive.

I didn't include the transportation costs of going back home. I figured, I could still continue with my education without going home all the time. (My mother did!) Also, the costs of uniforms were not included but the estimates are heavily padded so it should cover it. (And if memory serves me right, my godmother, a home economics teacher, made her students do the uniforms as a "project" so we probably got it for free except for the cloth.)

Comparing this with <a href="http://blog.scriptchaos.com/2012/11/13/bob-ong-and-the-cost-of-an-education/#more-844" target="_blank">Pam's breakdown</a>, it's easy to conclude that if you have family in the city you're going to study in, it's much much cheaper.

Despite being in public schools my whole life, this still amounted to a lot of money. No wonder my parents never bought us gaming consoles. Who can afford that, anymore?
