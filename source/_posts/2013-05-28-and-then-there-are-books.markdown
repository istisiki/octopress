<blockquote>And then there are books […] which you can’t tell people about, books so special and rare and yours that advertising your affection feels like a betrayal.</blockquote><br/>
I feel this way about a lot of things that I really really like. Not so much as a betrayal but it scares me that the people I tell about these things might not like it the way I do. Not because it's horrible but more on finding out that people don't like it. Does this make sense?

Also, I feel like when people go over the top to praise something, that special <em>ompf</em> this something has chips away a tad bit. I don't want to do that. I don't want people to dismiss how great something is because they know I'm a total fangirl of it.
