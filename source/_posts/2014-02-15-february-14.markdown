I would like to document this emotion. It's rare that I get this way and
on Valentine's Day no less. It must be the five beers.


I am aware that what I'm feeling can be classified as infatuation. I
fancy myself a musician. You're a musician. Please know that I don't
believe in lurve at first sight and all that jazz. It doesn't help that
this just all seems **typical**.


I felt all giggly inside when you looked my way whilst singing. You even
waited that I smile back before you looked away. Or it could've been the
five beers smiling at me or maybe it was really you. Either way I should 
have myself checked tomorrow because I'm pretty sure my internal organs 
all melted that instant. Predictable, again.


I'm deeply sorry for that pick up line... I didn't intend it to come out
that way. I didn't intend it to be a pick up line but looking back, it
does qualify as one.


When I opened the door you were already there--eleven steps and a few thought 
processes earlier than anticipated. My slightly buzzed brain wasn't fast
enough to come up with anything better. I didn't stand a chance.


Anyway...

Hello. I have your number. You have mine. Maybe we can talk some time.
