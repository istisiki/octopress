If playing an instrument is like making friends, pianists will definitely be the friendliest musicians of all. They can't carry their instruments. They have to make friends to a new piano every time they go to a new place to play in.

Violinists on the other hand, get to carry their instrument everywhere. Some of my violinist friends won't even play seriously unless they had their own violin with them. Violinists are total snobs. :P
