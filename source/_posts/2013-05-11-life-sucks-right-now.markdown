Almost two weeks ago I received a call from my mother. It's very rare for her to call me in the middle of the day and keep doing so even when I miss the first one. Usually if I miss the first call, she'd stop and call again in the evening because she knows that I'm probably too busy to answer the phone right then and there. But the rings kept coming. If the many books I've read or movies I've watched are any indication, calls like this can only be followed by two very opposite kinds of news. The one I got was of the negative kind.

Apparently my aunt was in intensive care for days now. The cause was unknown. Over the past month, she transformed from the outgoing aunt with a sunny disposition to a woman who can barely keep her consciousness. My mother knew for some time now but opted not to tell us. The fact that she was telling me was enough of a clue to indicate that the burden is already spilling over.

Icing to the cake--my father's mother had a stroke. She's going strong at 84. She was strong enough to survive the stroke but a vein in her left eye was not. The eye became infected. The cost of the operation to remove the infection and fix the eye can buy a decent car. That's just for the operation itself.

My father would give the sun and moon a hundred times over and over if it would mean my grandmother would be okay. My mother would give the last drop of her blood if it would mean her sister would live through this. But... our family still have three kids in school. Practicality is a must. It's the first time my parents ever asked financial aid from me and it's not even for their own sake. I've already given a lot but it frustrates me that it didn't even dent the bills.

Lots of hard lessons here.

<em>This week my aunt was released from the hospital. She can already walk around but only very slowly and only for very short bursts. Her appetite is back which is very good news. She's up for a follow up consultation next week.</em>

<em>My grandmother, though, is still due for operation and we don't have enough resources yet. :(</em>
