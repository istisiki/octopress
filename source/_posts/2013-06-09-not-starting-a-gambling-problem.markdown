I've never really gambled apart from the <em>a la</em> <em>tambay sa eskina </em>style<em>,</em> betting small amounts on card games like Pusoy, Chikicha, and Poker. So when Fred and Pam suggested we go to Casino Filipino, I jumped at the opportunity. If life were a Role Playing Game, we were unlocking some badge or achievement.

We made an agreement to not spend more than 500 pesos inside the casino. Kevin, being the most experienced among us, was exempted from this rule. He already had a 1000-peso chip in hand.

We had to go through a female guard who spoke to me exclusively in choppy English. She must've thought I was Korean so I put her out of her misery by saying "Asa ibutang, Miss?" referring to my umbrella. Shiela was asked about her age which she very conveniently forgot at the time of the inquiry.

When we went in, we made a bee line for the slot machines. In the back of my head, I was thinking this must be partly because this game is against a machine so there's less shame if you lose. Ha! Pam and Poy were quick to try it out. When Poy won enough to break even + 20 pesos, we cheered like we won the jackpot. I saw people look our way. They must've thought the same thing.

After that, we left the smoke-filled non-smoking area of old ladies and old men and went to up for higher stakes games. We passed by a bunch of poker tables. Kevin was quick to point out that the poker players don't like it when people stand behind them to watch the game. True enough, the only people near the poker tables were the players themselves.

We landed on the second floor, also smoke filled and about 20x busier than the slot-machine floor. There were different kinds of games being played. The types of games you see in movies--Black Jack, Craps, Lucky 9, Poker (but well...), Roulette, and others I can't identify. We watched for a while trying to gauge which games we can enjoy the most with our limited resources.

Black Jack and Poker were too nerve-wracking. Craps was too scary what with the lady and that stick she keeps slamming on the table!  Lucky 9 was too superstitious. We went in for Roulette and found a table with a bored-looking dealer. The most important detail was the minimum is 20 pesos. We played less than 10 games, I think. Kevin won (and lost) 2,000 pesos worth, proving our theory that Lady Luck favors gamblers. When Kevin finally lost, our table's dealer sighed as if saying "I'd have to sit around doing nothing again..."

After losing our money we went back down with the intention of leaving but Fred insisted that he should get something out of his 500 pesos. He made himself a cup of free coffee while Kevin and Terence fiddled with the automatic Craps machine.

We went home empty handed but we now know what it is like inside a real casino. Not nearly as glamorous as the movies. Our consolation--a free round of drinks c/o Wagee.
