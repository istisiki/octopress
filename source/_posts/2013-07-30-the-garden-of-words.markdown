This is a very well made anime both visually and in story.Think in the level of Hayao Miyazaki but with more mature characters. Mature as in grown up, not err... green.

I've only ever seen one other anime by Makoto Shinkai (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o6sZ8K3Vy0" target="_blank">5 centimeters per second</a>) a few years back. Both films share a lot in terms of characterization, story, pacing, visuals.

I like how Shinkai can make a film about love and not make the word so "in your face". There should be more to the story than that. Stories should begin with characters. What happens to them might be the focus of the story but you should think of the characters as if they already existed before the story happened.

This might explain why I seem to have an affinity for stories beyond what is presented in the narrative. This applies to books, movies, anime, etc. It makes you wonder beyond the story. Somehow, this makes me feel like I'm part of how the characters came to be. This short film is full of those stories beyond the story.

Both the cinematography and the story have so many parallels and metaphors. As if the stunning visuals are not enough to drown in.

[SPOILER BEYOND THIS POINT]

I'm not exactly a fan of how Akizuki and Yukino resolved things in the stairway scene. That was probably its only allusion to popular rom-coms--the obligatory chase the guy/girl to stop them from getting away.

But they quickly amended this slip by not letting Yukino change her plans of going away just for Akizuki. Realistic enough for me so they're forgiven.

[/END OF SPOILERS]

I can already think of someone who should watch this short film. (Armie, I'm looking at you!)
