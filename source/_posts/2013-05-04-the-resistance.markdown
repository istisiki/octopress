This game is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_(game)" target="_blank">The Resistance</a>.

My office friends seem to be drawn to games that involve logical skills--<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)" target="_blank">Mafia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whist" target="_blank">Whist</a>, just about any card game, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cebutrivianight?fref=ts" target="_blank">Trivia</a> (?). You get the idea.

The Resistance is a card game very similar to the game Mafia. The difference is this one is more structured.

Knowing my friends, things are about to get bloody. In a good way. :)
