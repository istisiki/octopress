I'm doing a new personal project. I like to call it the 8:36pm Habit.
The idea is to take a picture of whatever is directly in front of you at
20:36 (8:36pm). You do this everyday until forever. (If you miss a day,
you won't die. I promise.) 

I took the idea from [Buster Benson's own personal project][836pm]. 
He's been doing it for 5 years (a few days shy but let's give it to him) 
and I'm in awe of the amount of pictures he's accumulated.

Of course, in 2009 Instagram was yet to be conceived so he's beeen posting 
it on Flickr and there's [a whole community of people doing this
project][community]. (Ok, maybe they're a community of like five
people.)

### So why am I doing this?

I guess I'm obsessed with personal data. I want to be able to quantify
the things happening to me. Hours of sleep. Running mileage. Heart
rate. Weather patterns. (Kidding. Or am I?) It might be a direct result
of being the spawn of a statistician but that link has not yet been
proven.

It's quite a challenge to do this regressively. So I thought I'd start now 
and give my future self a break. Reminds me of this XKCD webcomic:

<a href="https://xkcd.com/974/">
<img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_general_problem.png" title="I
find that when someone's taking time to do something right in the
present, they're a perfectionist with no ability to prioritize, whereas
when someone took time to do something right in the past, they're a
master artisan of great foresight.">
</a>

Pictures aren't exactly "quantifiable" per se but we'll still see a
pattern (or lack thereof).

### Longitudinal Study

A single picture won't be a perfect representation of the whole day but a 
single sample taken everyday for the next few years will hopefully 
tell me something useful. If not, then at least we get pictures to be all
nostalgic about.

I won't know the real value unless I do it so I might as well. After
sometime has passed, I'll review all the samples and see what I've been
up to. This makes me really excited for time to pass. Like those times
when I setup a time lapse camera.

### Setup

- **Make sure you always have your camera or camera phone.** Duh. Or at
  least make sure you have it by 8:36pm.
- **Set an alarm for 8:36pm.** It has to be 8:36pm. If not, you might as
  well be in the uncool 8:37pm community.
- **Store the picture somewhere.** The recommended platform is Flickr but 
  you can post it wherever--Instagram, Facebook, your blog, your hard
  disk. My Instagram is a hibernating polar bear that only recently
  unlocked the "Load More" badge. I'm posting these there.
- (If you're going to post it somewhere) **make sure the caption starts
  with 8:36pm** or 20:36. I've decided to use the more common convention
  so search engines won't have to work so hard.
- **If you miss a day, DON'T PANIC.** 8:36pm will come around again
  tomorrow.

Here are a few I've taken in the past three days. Oh, and I only started
three days ago.
