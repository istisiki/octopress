_Please excuse all grammer and spellage mistakes. I am now very sleepy._

Four days to go before the big day. The number of days left is now less than the
number of days we will play. I haven’t been able to thoroughly
digest just how big this is. It was only a month ago, I realized that after
this when they say "the Philippines broke the world record" they will
mean us. "The Philippines" is us. Not just us the players, but everyone
who helps out in any way.

but you wouldn't know it with these faces.)<br/>

I’m anxious but only on the logical level. It has not yet elevated to
the level of speeding heartbeats. My mind races but my pulse is calm. I
will start being legitimately nervous twenty minutes before the game
starts, as always.

I hope it all runs smoothly. I hope it doesn’t rain. I hope no one gets
injured. I hope we don’t get disqualified on a technicality. I am
confident we can finish the 101 hours.

More importantly, I hope that our dedication to bringing this glory to
Cebu and to the Philippines will inspire you enough to give a few pesos
to our beneficiary. Our main goal (pun very much intended) is to raise
enough funds for the operation of 30 kids with congenital heart defects.
