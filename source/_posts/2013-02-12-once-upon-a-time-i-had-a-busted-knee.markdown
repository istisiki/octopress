I still do but I'm hoping in the near future this will find it's way into the past tense. There will be more times I will read this blog entry with "it" being a past event.

It all started with an innocent excursion at the beach. We wanted awesome photographs. I performed an awkward slide which resulted in an even more awkward half-split with my right leg bent in a very awkward manner. There was pain. Lots of it. But after a few exclamations of <em>"agay"</em> and maybe throw in a holy word or two and I was up, walking around, and taking photos again.

I did a few some "checks" to see if I was still "good as new", I walked, ran, did a few squats. All seemed well. Minor pain (maybe a four or a three on a scale of ten) compared to the 7/10 pain I felt when I tried to get up. I thought I was fine until the next morning when I woke up, I limped like there was no tomorrow. Something was up.

When I arrived at the doctor's office, his nonchalance reassured me. It can't be that serious if the doctor isn't even batting an eyelash over it. Looking back at that meeting though, I think he was more of the "not really caring much about patients" kind. He recommended I wear a knee brace--the only useful thing he ever told. After seven weeks, this doctor recommended I see a physiatrist.

At this point I was already walking fine without limping (or at least I don't think I do. I don't limp, do I?) and I've gained most of my normal range of motion. I don't feel pain unless my right leg is twisted (even slightly) inward while I put weight on it. The worst problem I have now is that I can never fully straighten out my right knee. It looks normal but looking down at it from my angle I can see my right knee poking out slightly more than my left knee.

The physiatrist explained to me that I am exhibiting symptoms of a <a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00358" target="_blank">meniscal tear</a>. Scary sh t. The worst thing that can happen is they'd have to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0CtzoBBl8" target="_blank">do surgery</a> on my knee to repair the tear or to make a clean cut on the tear so it won't be as painful. My doctor recommended two weeks of physical therapy to see if anything changes.

Physical therapy for my injury consists of: 5 minutes ultrasound therapy; 5 minutes assisted stretching; 20-30 minutes doing all sorts of ridiculous-looking strengthening exercises for the hamstrings, calf, and the glutes; 10 minutes on the stationary bike; 10 minutes walking at a snail's pace (sorry snails) on the treadmill.

Two weeks of all this hard work and marvelling at how strong these women physical therapists actually are, and my knee is still as stubborn as ever. It's been more than 2 months since the incident. I think I already forgot how to NOT compensate for my perpetually bent knee. I haven't gone for a run in what feels like forever. I even missed my <a href="http://aktib.ph/events/21-cebu-city-marathon-2013" target="_blank">CCM</a> debut. (<em>You see what I did there? ;)</em> )

Moral of this story:
<ul>
	<li>never underestimate pain</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RICE_(medicine)" target="_blank">RICE technique</a> is very important (rest, ice, compress, elevate)</li>
	<li>if your doctor didn't even so much as look at your injury during your visit, get another doctor.</li>
	<li>don't do slides on the beach</li>
</ul>
I'm going to see my doctor today. She's probably going to recommend an MRI. The bright side: I get to have a fancy picture of my knee's insides.
