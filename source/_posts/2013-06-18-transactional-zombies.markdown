I just had the nerdiest dream. I don't remember much of the details but what stuck out the most are zombies and database transactions.

Our house was surrounded by zombies. Not <strong><em>that</em></strong> surrounded but they sprout out of nowhere so might as well have been. When I tried to go out, a hoard of zombies appeared at the door. I tried to kill them, of course. But, alas, this dream world of mine decided to adopt a The Matrix twist.

The zombies are programs. Their source is a database somewhere in the Matrix and this whole situation with the house being surrounded is locked in a database transaction. So, when it looks like we're about to finish off the last of the zombies, the Architect would reset the transaction without committing the changes.

Poof!

All effort, gone. The zombies are back.
