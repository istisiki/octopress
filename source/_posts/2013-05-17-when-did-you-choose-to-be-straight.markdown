This made my morning.

The bit with the woman and her bearded husband... <em>(at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=QJtjqLUHYoY#t=127s" target="_blank">2:07</a>, was he her husband? not really sure.)</em> She looked like she was really interested in how her husband would answer the question. <em>(The question being, "do you think people are born gay or they choose to be gay?")</em> When she said "Born gay. Absolutely.", he looks at her like they never really talked about this before.
