We've have this family tradition of taking family photos on the first day of
the new year. It's been tradition for as long as I can remember but it was only 
last year that I suggested to take the photos outside of the house. We needed 
more space. After all, there are now six full grown individuals in this family. 
Quite the step up from two adults and four little humans.

Confession Time: So this year we cheated and took the photos on the second day 
of the new year because new year's day was a rainy affair. :P

Happy New Year!
