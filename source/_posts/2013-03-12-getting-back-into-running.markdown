If you remember, I <a title="Once Upon a Time I Had a Busted Knee" href="http://blog.staceycardoso.com/2013/02/12/once-upon-a-time-i-had-a-busted-knee/">injured my knee</a> late last year. Official diagnosis after <a href="http://tumblr.staceycardoso.com/post/43481932495/whew-just-got-my-mri-result-no-evidence-of-a" target="_blank">my MRI</a>: Grade II Partial MCL tear.

It's been more than 3 months,Â I think I can start running again. There isn't any pain anymore except when I bend my right knee while lying down on my left side. Even then it's more of a minor nuisance than actual pain. For real this time, I mean it when I say your mother's pinch is 50x more painful. More importantly, there isn't any pain when I run the full 10 meters of our apartment's corridor.

I can't straighten my leg completely yet though. But there's just 5 degrees (or less) left until full extension so it's good as straight. My physical therapist did recommend that if I go running/walking for extended periods, I should place heel inserts on my right shoe to compensate for the slightly shorter right leg and to prevent the lower back pains that usually result from differing lengths of the leg. Even if the difference is just 5mm, it makes a world of difference.

This weekend, I'm going to try running. I'll do maybe 1km on a relaxed pace and check if there's any pain. If there isn't, I'll shoot for 3km. Let's do this!
