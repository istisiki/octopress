I almost named her Lucy after [Lucy Lawless][lucy] who gave life to [my 
childhood heroine][xena] but I wanted a less common name. I wanted to
keep the simplicity, though. Both names mean 'light', albeit in different
languages.

In Gaelic, it means ‘child’ and the ukulele is very much like a child
version of the guitar but not really.

In English it derives from Alana which means ‘fair’ or ‘good-looking’
and this ukulele is a thing of beauty. In a wonderful non-coincidence, in
the TV series [Once Upon a Time][ouat], Snow White’s Evil Queen, who is
traditionally portrayed as forever in a quest to be the fairest, 
is played by [Lana Parrilla][lana]. (I think she’s beautiful, too.) The
play in correlation is wonderful.

I’m not into the tradition of naming inanimate things but my soprano
ukulele had a name (Amélie, with the acute 'e' just like the quirky
movie). For symmetry, this one gets a name as well.

Meet Lana, my concert-sized all Acacia ukulele.

With my guide/salesman, Jando, a shy guy but one hell of a chatterbox
and eager to show me around their workshop.
