I never really meet new people. There are a lot of contributing factors as to why this is.
<ol>
	<li>Despite my young-ish age, I don't go to bars/clubs/whatever it is that people my age are supposed to be going to on Friday and Saturday nights. When I do, I go with friends. And we don't really go around playing "Have you met Fred?" (#himym) despite the potential entertaining values of such an activity.</li>
	<li>Also, I am very shy. Yes, friends, you are allowed to laugh at this claim. The people around me don't know the internal struggle I had to go through when I met them for the first time!</li>
</ol>
As a result, the people I make friends with are those that I constantly have to interact with--workmates, people in my orchestra, the woman who manages our filtered water provider. I'm not saying I don't want to make friends but having to interact so often gives me a chance to boost my confidence and prepare a response to "hi", "hellos", and "how many bottles of water do you want?".

Today, though, I met a stranger as I was waiting for the elevator to pass by my floor.Â <em></em>

"Is your name Stacey?", she said.

I said yes and she explained how she thought I was my sister Karen. They aren't friends but Karen is the girlfriend of a friend's friend and the tiny-ness of our university enables you to know stranger's names without being friends. (Ok ok.. I'll just admit it. My sister and I are sort of a celebrity. :P ) After looking really hard, she realized I am not Karen so I can only be her older sister.

I asked for her name. "Darlene", she said. "Stacey", I said before I realized that she already knew my name!

This doesn't happen very often and I am still a bit stunned. And I now understand how Ted (#himym) felt when I random stranger recognized him on the street. This isn't exactly the romantic kind like Ted's but it still feels like magic.
