If the house is burning and you don't have time to pack the bare necessities...
<ol>
	<li>Take a blanket and lay it open in the middle of the room.</li>
	<li>Shove as many clothes as possible on top of it.</li>
	<li>Tie the four corners together.</li>
	<li>Run.</li>
</ol>
Best advice papa gave so far.
