"Just drop me off here", said Shiela to The Dragon, one block before reaching IT
Park.

"Are you ashamed of me?" asked The Dragon, suddenly self-conscious of
his species and the implications of being found with one.

Shiela turned to The Dragon, silently wondering if this was how she
wanted her morning to start, caught in a not-so-peaceful farewell, with
more things unsaid than in a Charlie Chaplin movie.

"I am not ashamed OF you", she said, "I'm ashamed WITH you."

"Three years after working here, my colleagues still don't suspect a thing.
If they see you, they might make the connection. Our species is
dwindling. You wouldn't want them to slay us, would you?", Shiela
murmured.

"Oh, I don't think they'd slay us. I am the DRAGON! Mightiest of all beasts!"

Just as The Dragon uttered those words, a gust of wind came in from the east, 
with little curly strands caught up in the breeze. Fred was somewhere near.

"My human, I can smell your curly friend nearby. The fragrance of his
curly hair is very distinct. Are you sure we should hide? Maybe it's
time to reveal me to your friends in all my GLORY."

Suddenly, a loud voice resounded from the skies. "My sons and daughters!
The time is yet inappropriate for us to reveal ourselves! My plan has
not come to fruition, the world is not ready for us." It was the voice
of Pam Drogo, 1st of her name, Rightful Queen of Caresharing, Mother of
Dragons and Reports.

"What's the matter?" Shiela asked The Dragon still shit-scared with the
mighty Pam Drogo's voice. 

"Nothing. I'd better go. Time will come and all your friends will know the 
glory of our kind."

It was silent for a moment.

"However," the voice was back again, much quieter this time. "There is
one tiny thing you must do for me."

"Find the ones named Fred and Odina, and reduce them to piles of ash."
