A very important person got married this weekend. Despite her importance
to me, I didn't go. I couldn't go. Not to be overly dramatic, but I
think it would've done something terrible and permanent to my pshyche.

**Why?**
Because the person who got married was Michelle. 

**Who is Michelle?**
A very important person. Please don't make me elaborate further. I think
you are smart enough to figure this out. I'm not going to say that word here. 
I didn't say it to her because I think it's selfish of me.

Anyway...
