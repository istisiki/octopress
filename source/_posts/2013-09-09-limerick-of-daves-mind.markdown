<p dir="ltr">Dave has an interesting mind.
His remarks are one of a kind.
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Some code he once read,
</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">To praise it he said,
</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">“In the sky the stars were aligned!”</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Dave is an officemate of ours. He has a penchant for catching people off guard with the things he says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Would you want to change the environment you are in?"
"What are your outputs from your processed experiences?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">No, he's not interviewing a prospective employee. That's just how he talks. All day err'day.</p>
