"There's a first time for everything," they say. I thought the Cebu City Marathon 
2014 was going to be my first full marathon. It was actually my first DNF.

I've never NOT finished a race before. Sure, there were situations where I had 
to give away my slot because I was injured (*cough* CCM 2013, 21km *cough*) or 
my alarm clock didn't wake me up (we laugh about this now but I sure wasn't 
laughing about it then) but I a DNF is <strong>never</strong> an option.

So when they asked me to ride the coaster with the other runners that were done 
for this race I asked, "how far before I reach the tunnel?" I did the math a 
few kilometers earlier. I've accepted the fact that I won't be finishing before 
the cut off time of seven hours. Not unless I ran 8min/km pace--my starting pace, 
no less. So when I asked how far, I really just wanted to get past the tunnel 
before they open it again for normal traffic. At least then I can finish the 
race for my pride. Nothing else. No medal. No loot bag. Not even a towel.

But the dude who was very eager to get me into that coaster didn't even bat an 
eyelash. He took out his permanent marker and drew an 'X' on my bib. I can't 
help but notice it didn't write well anymore and wondered if it was just old or 
if it had been used to write on wet race bibs far too many times. He took away 
all the important stubs from my race bib and gave me a grape-flavored Gatorade. 
I don't even like this flavor!

When I entered the coaster, there were two other no-longer-running runners there. 
The other one I met along the road when I noticed she was walking weird and 
assumed (correctly) that she probably needed some petroleum jelly. We talked a 
bit and discovered that we had a few things in common (other than a CCM DNF)--
we were both first time marathoners and we were both shooting for the All Women 
Ultramarathon. That's something we can both look forward to, at least.

They dropped us off at I.T. Park. By then we were a lonely party of nine 
temporarily decommissioned runners. Still wet from the non-stop downpour and 
with the wind blowing rather wildly, I realized it was cold. A towel for the 
DNF coaster would've been nice.
