We went to Hong Kong last week. I'm still too stubborn/lazy/busy/shaken 
(by the earthquake aftershocks) to actually post a proper blog. So before I 
get lazy I'll just post this short one.

We went to Ocean Park Hong Kong on our fourth day in this foreign land. They 
had this Old Hong Kong themed part and we found a telephone box there. (Not a 
police box but close enough!) It was red but we're Whovians so we did The 
Doctor proud.

The photo was actually inspired by the Threadless Shirt Odina was wearing that
day. [This one.][threadless]
