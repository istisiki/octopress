At 5:44am on March 9, 2014 I finished my first marathon. I was so
excited I just had to send a text to a few of my friends. 42 grueling
kilometers at roughly seven hours and thirty minutes. If this was the 
Cebu City Marathon (CCM), I still would not have finished on time but 
the point is, I did finish. Now I only needed to tackle eight kilometers
more. We were running a 50km ultra-marathon after all.

The All Women Ultramarathon (AWUM) registration came too early for my
liking. I wanted to successfully finish a marathon first before I even
considered running a meter in excess of 42 kilometers. But I wanted that
ultramarathon. Here was a perfect debut race. So even though I was one
week premature of <a

target="_blank">my first marathon (and finding out that I didn’t have
the legs for it after all)</a> I registered.

My game plan for the race was to reach our water station at KM33 at the
very least. I imagined I can renew my resolve with my friends before I
tackle the remaining 17 kilometers. <a href="http://www.owrange.com/">Rose</a>, was having none of it.
Together with <a href="http://waratrunner.wordpress.com/">Armie</a>, she devised a game plan for the three of us: never
let Stacey out of sight. They didn’t word it as such because they’re
kind to my ego but I got the message. :)

So that’s how the three of us found ourselves still running together at
KM30, evaluating what pace we could do from that point on. This was our
second “race assessment”. At KM20, we decided to do a 3-2 run/walk pace.
Before that we were doing 4-1. Now, we’ve decided to go for 2-1. Our
runs were never faster than 8min/km. (Rose wanted it to be slower but
they were doing 8:30min/km easy so I never alerted them when it was
going faster than 9min/km.) Our walks were never slower than 12min/km. I
was in-charge of taking note of our “moment pace” and Armie was
in-charge of keeping time.

Maybe it was the fact that for the entirety of this challenge I was
running with two of the more popular runners in Cebu but I didn’t feel
too tired even as we were crossing the virtual KM42 mark. I can only
dream of this during CCM. Rose and Armie kept bumping into their running
friends who had nothing but smiles for us. By association, I guess they
were also greeting me and seriously, a smile and a kind word go a long
way when it feels like your legs are about to fall off.

Or maybe it was the beer. Several of the stations were serving beer, you
know. People sharing beer are several times friendlier and light-hearted
than sober humans. Or maybe it was just the carbs in the beer.

AWUM is definitely one of the most well-loved runs in Cebu. We were
joking that the runner to photographer ratio was 1:1. The runner to
support crew member ratio was probably 1:7 if not more. Most of them
volunteers. There’s a water station every two kilometers. A rarity when
it comes to ultramarathons which have a culture of minimalism and
self-sufficiency.

When I finished my first half-marathon (21km), I felt like a superhero.
I felt like doing some saving--a cat stuck on a tree or an old lady
crossingthe street if not rescuing a child from a burning house. But as
I crossed the AWUM finish line at around 7-ish am, I felt very humbled. I
could not have done this without the support of so many support crew
volunteers who were equally as sleep deprived as the runners, or without
Armie and Rose who were constantly keeping my pace in check, or my nerdy
friends who were decidedly non-nerdy that night and were manning the Runroo
aid station instead.
