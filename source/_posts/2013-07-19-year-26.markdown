My 25th passed by without so much as a second glance. It was over before I even perfected writing 25 as my age in the forms. I realized belatedly that 25 is like a big deal. A quarter of a life has passed. Assuming I live to be a hundred.

This year is much the same. My willingness to celebrate is inversely proportional to how much it is expected that I celebrate. Somehow, this makes me feel older. There's a different set of 26-year-olds that go out every friday and party like there's no tomorrow. Me and my friends are obviously not in that set. I think. (Unless they have an alternative life that I don't know of.)

The last time I remember anticipating my birthday was when I was in 3rd grade and my mama and papa gave me the obligatory birthday recess celebration. I burped a hundred times as a dare that day because I told one of my classmates I can do it on command. After which, I almost puked but I still managed to down the Zest-O that I won.

I didn't plan the day to begin this way but we did have some beer. We decided to try out the beers that appeared in one of the Trivia Night categories.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">And I did have some (cup)cake.</span>

Also, we almost perfected our streak of winning trivia night first place everytime one of us is celebrating their birthday but... yeah... almost. (We got 2nd place.)

So the night didn't go all for naught.

I'm sure I wouldn't be able to remember all the important things that happened in the past year but these are the ones that affect how the days go by now.

	<li>Really got into board games. Only a little over a year ago, our in-between-rounds entertainment during Trivia Night were ordinary card games like Whist, Poker, or Chikicha. Things escalated rather quickly.</li>
	<li>(Some might not consider this an achievement but...) I finished season 3 to 6 of Doctor Who. By my standards, that's fast.</li>
</ul>
I wonder what new haircut I'll come up with in the next 12 months. I wonder how my parents would be like if they were 26-year-olds today. WIll they watch anime, too? I wonder what books I'd be reading and if they'd change how I think. Will this be the year I learn to swim?

This time next year I will already be in sync with the latest Doctor Who. I'd be sleeping before 1am on most nights. (Don't ask me what time I go to bed now!) I will already have something to share about international travel. I will already be illustrating my own webcomic. I will already be an ultra-marathoner.

So here's to the coming year. Let's make it memorable.
