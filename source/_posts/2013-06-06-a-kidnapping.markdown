Last night I dreamt I was kidnapped by a crazy lady who looked a lot like Reese Witherspoon. She grabbed me as I was passing by the old Alejandro's behind Cebu Doctor's Hospital and carried me off to her house in classic kidnapper's form. Crazy strong!

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I escaped and ran to the nearest police station. The police can't believe that a Reese Witherspoon look-alike would do a thing like this so they called her to the station. I believe this was partly because they wanted to verify for themselves if indeed she looked like Ms. Witherspoon or I was just crazy.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Upon arrival, <em>(and confirming that indeed this woman looked like the exact copy of the Hollywood superstar)</em> the police decided to put the two of us through a series of physical and mental tests in the style of Survivor. Whoever succeeds must be favored by the gods and is therefore telling the </span>truth. Too barbaric for my taste and I think my dream self only went along with it because it was a Survivor style obstacle course.<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">We couldn't finish it so they made the two of us sleep in the station and I woke up to a murder <em>(not mine and not my doing)</em> and a vandalized face c/o my abductor.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">When I woke up, I checked my face for any strange markings.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><em>Fin.</em> </span>

<em>(I think this has a lot to do with last night's Trivia Night. Reese Witherspoon appeared in one of the visual categories.</em>)
