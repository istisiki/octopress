For the majority of the past year I thought I was already 27 so actually
turning 27 was a bit anticlimatic.

As usual, I like to recap the year and sort of plan ahead what I want to
do until my next birthday.

Things done:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
  <a href="http://blog.staceycardoso.com/2013/09/11/orchestral-dreams/" _target="blank">I got into the [Cebu Philharmonic Orchestra</a>
</strong> It was
  awesome but then I realized, as much as I like playing the violin, I'm
not totally into the this music scene. I still play classical with a
select group of friends, and we actually enjoy it.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
<a href="http://blog.staceycardoso.com/2013/10/23/tardis-in-hong-kong/" _target="blank">I went to my first international trip</a>
</strong>
Not as daunting
  as I imagined it would be. Bless the souls of all those travel bloggers and 
my friend Rose for figuring out how to enjoy the trip as best we can.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
I tried to run <a
href="http://blog.staceycardoso.com/2014/01/13/first-time-for-everything/" _target="blank">my first marathon but failed</a>.
</strong> 
I think
  it was all in the mind. I got stopped 11kms before the finish line but
if I just made it to the end of SRP before they had to open it again, I
could've finished. Damn the seven-hour cut off.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
<a href="http://blog.staceycardoso.com/2014/02/04/8-36pm-habit/" _target="blank">I started my 8:36pm project.</a>
</strong> I even got to 
  <a

_target="blank">talk about it in one of the PechaKucha Nights in Cebu.</a>
It's a bit exciting to see some of my friends are doing it as well.
<a href="http://www.owrange.com" _target="blank">Rose</a> in particular posts some really interesting photos
for her 8:36pm. <a href="http://instagram.com/fredbaa" _target="blank">Fred</a> is on it as well but a lot of times our
photos are similar. Haha!
</li>
<li>
<strong>
I tried to run <a href="http://blog.staceycardoso.com/2014/03/15/girl-power/" _target="blank">my first ultra-marathon and finished!</a>.
</strong>
  Whew! At least I got to redeem myself this time around.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MyDragonEatsCatFood" _target="blank">Started a band with my sister.</a>
</strong>
We're still pretty new and
  we only have a few originals but we're working really hard. Having a
band was our childhood dream. It took us a while but now we're acting on
it. For now, we don't have gigs outside of going to The Outpost's
Ukulele Sundays. This way we get to build our confidence in front of a
crowd and it pushes us to learn something new every week.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
<a href="http://blog.staceycardoso.com/2014/04/30/meet-lana/" _target="blank">Bought a new ukulele.</a>
</strong> Finally, right? After the first
  time we played for Ukulele Sundays, I figured we couldn't keep playing
with my tiny non-amplified soprano ukulele. I bought a new one. It's
really pretty and already it's had its own adventures.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Bought a new phone.</strong> All because I couldn't revive my
old iPod Touch and my <a href="http://blog.staceycardoso.com/2013/06/28/too-soon/"
_target="blank">old phone was already really old</a> (though not yet as
old as my oldest phone) and I could no longer install Spotify on it.
Fred was very pleased with my upgrade.
</li>
</ul>

Things we weren't able to do:
<ul>
<li> My own web comic </li>
</ul>

Things we'd like to do:
<ul>
<li>Run the Cebu City Marathon and finish.</li>
<li>Run the All Women Ultra-marathon again so we can claim it wasn't just
  a fluke</li>
<li>Make a lot of songs for My Dragon Eats Cat Food. Enough for an album
  or more! Ambitious but whatever.
</li>
</ul>
