I've recently acquired my first sports watch--the Garmin 310XT. I'm one of those people that like watching the numbers go up so I guess this is perfect for me. I'm also hoping to improve my running and in the absence of an actual human coach, the closest I can get is monitoring my stats as I go. There are lots of resources online on how to go about training yourself. What they all require though is a more or less accurate idea of your stats--pace, HRM, etc.

Anyway, here is the Garmin, boxed and unboxed.

8min/km pace is about the same pace I had with my first run more than a year ago. I guess being away for 5 months has taken it's toll!
