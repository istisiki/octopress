At dinner last night, one of the topics we talked about was how difficult it was to teach our parents to use technology. I remember very clearly how I had to repeat the instructions for my parents on how to access their email. This was in 2000. I was in first year high school and dial up internet was at 30-40 Philippine Pesos per hour.

I ended up writing down detailed steps accompanied by "wonderful" illustrations. (Me: You type "www.yahoo.com" in the address bar. Mama: Where's the address bar again?). I did this for everything--how to zip/unzip, how to search for stuff, etc.

In 2009, my mama made a facebook account all on her own. (And I believe, it was just last year that she tried to make a twitter account also on her own.) She's also able to book her flights online all on her own. (I did give her a thorough discussion on web security when I found out, though!) She can buy a new phone and I don't have to teach her how to change the wallpaper or how to add a new contact number. She can do these all on her own! I feel like I have to give her a badge every time she does these things.

What's the difference? I think it has a lot to do with how design these days are more intuitive and closing in on feeling more natural. Of course, every now and then, Pam's mother still calls her to ask why she can't login to her gmail account in yahoo. We'll get there.
