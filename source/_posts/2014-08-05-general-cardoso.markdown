They were attacking us and were very close to breaking down our
defenses. I ran to the back of the room and hid behind a computer table.
You can still see me, though. 
Apparently, in my dreams I am both a coward and an idiot. 

Right before the door burst open, I shouted, "EVERYONE GET DOWN!!!"
Wait. Was I the commander? Yay me! But no time to celebrate. 
The imbacile of a computer technician did not wear his camoflage today
and on top of that his shirt was bright red. He was also 
standing right beside me. I told him again, "Get down, idiot!" but he
wouldn't.

Thus we were captured.

When I woke up (still in the dream) I was in a minature version of my
hometown. My hometown being Jerusalem. Why I knew this, I
don't know and why wasn't it Catbalogan, I don't know either.

The opposing commander was there and she told me, "Since you've been a
very good prisoner..." (but I was just sleeping the whole
time!) "...I will allow you to have ham and bacon for breakfast. Also,
you need to take care of my daughter."

The daughter turned out to be a super brat and there was no bacon in the
kitchen. Not even ham.

We finally convinced ourselves that we can escape this minature town by
outrunning the daughter. We tried that but even my
master camoflage skills could not hide me.

No matter. It was Grammy Awards Night anyway and the war was going to be
on hold. Ella, Cattski, and Ara (Lim!) came to get me.
Ara handed out the Instax cameras. The Grammy's are very generous with
their party favors. We rode to the venue on Cattski's
motorbike. She insists we hold our left hand up while riding, including
herself so she was driving one-handed.

But when we arrived at the venue, it was actually just the McDonald's in
Tacloban. And yes, the Grammy Awards was just a ploy
to get the war to stop long enough to rescue me. (Man! I'm so important
in this dream!)

When I told my friends who were already half-way through their sundaes
and fries, they didn't believe me when I said Cattski
and Ella rescued me. But they believe me when I told them I was the
commander of our army. :|
