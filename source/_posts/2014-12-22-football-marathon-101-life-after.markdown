I've been trying to verbalize my thoughts on the aftermath of
<TODO>Kick for Life: Football Marathon 101</TODO> but everything is so
overwhelming that my brain just crashes and I try not to get too
sentimental-emotional-and-sh t.

I figured we should start with the "now", life after Kick for Life.

Well, immediately after FM101, we went out to celebrate the Filipino
way--beer and karaoke. Yup, we just played 101 hours of football but we
still had energy to spare.

This is something surprising for me--we were not as tired as I imagined
we would have been. We have our coaches to thank for that, all of them
who handled pre and on event player management: Coach Kidd, Coach Alan,
Geno, Yaz, Brah James, and Sir Ricky.

After the le petite party, I was off to a 5-hour sleep. Another
surprise, I thought I'd spend more time in dreamland but my circadian
rhythm had other plans. Even to this day, I have a hard time sleeping
for longer than 4 hours straight. Waking up in the middle of the night
has become a regular thing.

Thankfully, I didn't actually lose any weight due to training and the
actual event. If anything, I even gained weight though people would
swear (our HR mainly) that I now look leaner. My tummy fats are think
otherwise.

What I didn't notice during our trainings was how Christmas was creeping
in on us.
