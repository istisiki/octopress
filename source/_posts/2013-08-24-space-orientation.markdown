We played <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=18&amp;enmi=Battlestar%20Galactica" target="_blank">Fantasy Flight's Battlestar Galactica</a> game last night. I've seen the series and I really liked it. The objective of the game is to get to Cobol by "jumping" via the fleet's FTL drives. Cylons are on your tail. Even when you jump, they're still on to you. I started protesting by saying that can't be right because unless the transmission of the jump coordinates were somehow decoded by the Cylons, they had no way of knowing where to jump. Yes, there were Cylons disguised as skin jobs but they couldn't have known, right? Oh, but it turns out that our president for that game (Daryl, who chose to be Dr. Baltar) was a Cylon. He might've leaked the coordinates.

Daryl played Dr. Baltar. Terence played Helo. (I knew there was some bromance going on between the two.) I played Starbuck (not in the photo)[/caption]

As I was imagining the many scenarios of how the Cylons could've followed us or waited for us at our jump's destination, I also started imagining space orientation. There's no gravity in space. So there is no "right-side-up". How is it though that whenever ships appear at a location that already has ships, the ships seem to be orienting themselves the same way? That can't be right.

Maybe the ships' computers at that time are so advanced that they orient the ships according to the orientation of the majority of the ships in the area. If all ships have this algorithm, then everyone will be pseudo-right-side-up all the time. Even so, I still need to account for the time it takes to re-orient the ship. Or can the artificial gravity within the ship be enough to mask a sudden flip?

It's funny how one of the first things Ender does when he goes to space is figure out space orientation. I started reading Ender's Game this morning.
