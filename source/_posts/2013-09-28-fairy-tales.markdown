> [at 4:04] The kiss--it's like every little girl's dream. right?

Not every little girl, surely. When I read/watched fairy tales as a kid, I
thought it was a lesson on how simple-minded the princesses were.

For example in Snow White (incidentally the book my mother used to teach me how 
to read English), the part where she takes the apple from a total stranger and 
eats it--I thought the lesson here was not to eat stuff from strangers. Of 
course, my fairy tales were coupled with *enkanto* stories from my 
*yaya* and my *lola.* Old ladies are especially suspicious! You 
know how they say that if you eat food from an *enkanto*, you'd be tied 
to their kingdom forever and never find your way back home.

In Sleeping Beauty, why in the world would she touch the pointy part of the 
spindle? For crying out loud! Who does that?

In Rapunzel, there is a witch/sorceress that can't climb up the tower unless 
Rapunzel helps her by throwing down her hair. Now this is a double feature. We 
have a sorceress who just waits for Rapunzel to help her up instead of using 
magic to get herself up there and we have a girl who, with the knowledge that 
the sorceress can't climb without her help, helps the witch every time instead 
of just letting the hag rot at the bottom of the tower.

Cinderella was miserable with her stepmother but it didn't occur to her to just
runaway.

As a breath of fresh air, in the story of Rumpelstiltskin, it was actually the 
antagonist who was lacking in the err.. thinking department. If he didn't want
them to know his name, why did he dance around the fire singing his name out 
loud?

I never really thought that the end game was to acquire this so called True
Lurve's Kiss. I thought the end game was not to get trapped in the first place
so you wouldn't need to be saved. It was only when I got a bit older that I
realized my interpretations weren't so mainstream. Come on little girls, 
there's got to be more interesting things to do than waiting to be saved.
