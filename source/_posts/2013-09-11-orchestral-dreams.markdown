    "Sometimes the music is just so good that you want to look around your fellow musicians and acknowledge that right here, there is magic."

    Yeah! =]

Just three days ago I attended my first rehearsal as a member of the 
[Cebu Philharmonic Orchestra][cpo] I'd like to take a moment for that to 
sink in.

If you know me enough, you'd know how big this is. It's pretty big.

You know how sometimes people say that things are just too good to be true that 
they thought they must've been dreaming. That has never happened to me before. 
Sure, I've had dreams that seem so real but never a reality that seemed so 
dreamy. Reality is so vivid whereas dreams are so "*watercolor-y*". 
When I received the message that told me I should be present at last Sunday's 
rehearsals, that was too good to be true. Surely, I was dreaming. The following 
evening, I checked my messages again. It was still there. Upon confirmation of 
its existence, I half expected that they'd take it back. "I'm sorry, Stacey. 
There was a mix up." So I retracted my tweet.

Sunday came and at 5pm, I was helping them fold the music stands after
rehearsal as if I've been doing this since I-don't-even-know-when.

When I started playing in an orchestra/ensemble, I could barely sight read. I 
remember my mentor back then had to do one-on-one lessons with me for the piece 
we were going to rehearse just so I can catch up with the group. I was seated 
at the back of the Second Violin Section [(1)][fyi]. Our principal player was 
12 years old. I was 19. We were rehearsing [Canon in D][canon-in-d]. It's a 
simple enough piece but I was struggling with it like 
you wouldn't believe. I didn't have talent, clearly, but I'd be damned if 
anyone ever told me I didn't work at it hard enough.

The first piece I practiced with the CPO was the 
[Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1][tchaikovsky].
I'm still in the Second Violin Section. It's become my specialty now, being a 
second violin. I don't think I can handle being a first. I still have to 
practice my parts because otherwise I'll be clambering to pace with everyone 
else.

There is something special about being part of a tight-knit music group. I find 
it more exhilarating to play when there are other people involved. These are 
individuals after all, with independent thoughts and yet, here they are making 
music together. It's so unbelievably intimate. I know there are music sheets 
but it still feels like there's something inexplicable about the whole thing.

This video illustrates what I'm talking about.

They don't have a conductor. Before they began, everyone was looking at the
concertmaster. He breathes in and lifts his bow to signal the beginning of the 
piece and from that moment everyone is... *dancing*. Every now and 
then, they look at each other. They genuinely look like they love what 
they're doing. At 2:58 of the video, that lady violinist looks at the camera 
and smiles as if there's a secret we don't know.

These aren't written in the music sheet. Sometimes the music is just so good 
that you want to look around your fellow musicians and acknowledge that right 
here, there is magic. You want to look at the audience and see if they caught 
on to the secret.

As cheesy and grossly cliche as it may sound... Dreams come true. Want it 
enough to actually work on it, other people will notice.
