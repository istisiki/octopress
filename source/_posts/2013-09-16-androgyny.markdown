The most embarrassing experience I've had
with being mistaken for a boy happened ironically when I still had long hair. I 
was 11 years old and I was waiting for my turn to use the public restroom. This 
group of girls about my age came in. If a Filipino version of The Ashleys from 
Recess came to being, they were it. After a few moments of blatantly staring at 
me, one of them came over and said, "The boys' room is on the other side." 
(In English, mind you, which further supports their being Ashleys.)

At this tender age, I have yet to gain enough experience with situations like
this to actually form a reaction other than embarrassment. I also have yet to
grow into the distinctly female anatomy that mother nature promised (else I 
would've done [this][youtube] and made the whole thing embarrassing for everyone) 
and I had the most awkward hair ever, so the mix-up wasn't unwarranted.

I walked out of there with very red ears and a still full bladder. I was 11.
Cut me some slack.

  brad, dong, or sir. ([Things You Don't Say to a Woman With Short Hair][buzzfeed]
</p>

I've had short hair for more than two years now. And since I haven't actually 
grown out of this androgyny about me and I don't exactly dress the part of 
girly girl on most days, it's still the source of confusion for so many. I've 
become so used to being called "brad", "dong", or "sir" that I can easily shrug 
it off and even find the whole thing funny. There's so much amusement that can 
be derived from people so confused that they switch from calling you "ma'am" or 
"sir" every five seconds. If I'm feeling particularly mean, I would put them out 
of their misery and watch them squirm as I say, "It's ma'am."
